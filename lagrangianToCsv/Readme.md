lagrangianToCsv
===============
This is a simple python script that reads a lagrangian file and gather all variables to a csv file.

## Description
For example, the OpenFOAM lagrangian sprayCloud data has the following structure:
```
$ ls 0.01/lagrangian/sprayCloud

 active   Cp   d0        injector   liquidCore   ms   nParticle   origProcId   positions   sigma   tc     tTurb    U      UTurb  'YC12H26(l)'
 age      d    dTarget   KHindex    mass0        mu   origId      position0    rho         T       tMom   typeId   user   y       yDot
```

Use the script to gather all variables to a csv file:
```
# Usage: python3 lagrangianToCsv.py <Root Path of the sprayCloud>
python3 lagrangianToCsv.py 0.01/lagrangian
```
Terminal output:

The script will create a csv file with the following structure:
```
origId,mass0,sigma,user,KHindex,tc,rho,T,nParticle,age,d0,mu,ms,Cp,Ux,Uy,Uz,d,origProcId,tMom,x,y,z,liquidCore

```
## Paraview Post-processing
- Load the csv file in Paraview
- Apply the `TableToPoints` filter
- Apply the `Glyph` filter to visualize the particles
